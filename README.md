## Task User Stories


Follow these steps:
● Create Minesweeper or another game of your choice (not Tic-Tac-Toe) using the Create React App Starter Kit.
● Ensure that the game adheres to the criteria listed below.

Criteria: 

1. It should be created using Create React App.
2. It should include attractively styled components (at least 4 different types of
components) that respond to user interaction. Feel free to use
React-Bootstrap or another library and/or your own custom stylesheets.
3. A number of components should be rendered using the array.Map() method. Each component rendered in this way should have a key that uniquely identifies it (see Task: React II).
4. User interaction should modify the state of some components.
5. The state of two or more components should be synced.
6. The user should be able to restart the game.
7. The user should be clearly informed if they have “won” or “lost” the game.
8. (Optional)The user should easily be able to request “help” that will inform the user
about the rules of the game from the UI.
9. The UI should be attractive, easy to use and intuitive.
10. It should include a file called “readMe.md” which explains the rules of the
game. This file should also provide clear instructions that an end user will be
able to follow to be able to install and run your app on their local machine.
11. Your mentor should be able to launch your app by typing ‘npm start’ from
the command line interface.
12. The file structure of the project should be well organized in line with
guidelines ​here​.
13. Your code should be well documented with appropriate comments. The
code should also be easy to read adhering to ​Google’s style guide about indentation, meaningful variable and component names etc.
