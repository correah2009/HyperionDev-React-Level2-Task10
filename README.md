## Task User Stories

Create a React app that:

○ Contains a Dropdown that allows a user to select which functionality they want to use on your site. The options should be ‘Currency converter’ and ‘Win!’.

○ Contains a component that converts currencies. This component should be displayed when the user selects ‘Currency converter’ from the Dropdown. The user should be able to enter a figure in dollars and the app should calculate and display the amount in South African Rands, UK pounds and Euros. The components that display the converted values should be children of the conversion component.
BONUS (personal challenge): Developed feature to add more currency inputs to see multiple currency conversions.

○ Contains a component that allows the user to play a simple game. This component should be displayed when the user selects ‘Win!’ from the Dropdown. The user should be shown three ‘Card’ components that they can click. When the user clicks on a ‘card’ the card should be ‘turned’ to reveal a message which either indicates that they’ve won a prize or that they’ve lost. They should only be able to pick one ‘card’ with each try. Once they’ve picked a ‘card’ they should no longer be able to click the ‘cards’ but should either be able to ‘Try again’ or ‘Quit’. The winning card should be different each time.
